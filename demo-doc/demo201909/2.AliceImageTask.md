# Prepare original image
Alice put her picture in a local folder which her Leo node can access. In our test case, she put the image under /demo-data folder. 
![Alice Original Color Picture](./images/AliceOriginalPicture.jpg)
The file name is IMG_28190701_1654519.JPG

Alice open WebUi and click the canned task "I have a sensitive private picture, want to process it to black and white securely".

![Alice create a compute task](./images/AliceCreateTask.png)

Please take a look at the lambdaCid. The hash need to be replaced by the hash Bob uploaded in his last step.

After paste Bob's image processing service hash, the UI looks like this:
![Pasted Bob task hash](./images/ReplaceWithBobTaskHash.png)

There are other properties on Alice's task. Please also take a look although most of them are just placeholder.
```js
{
  txType:"computeTask",
  userName,
  lambdaCid:"PLEASE_REPLACE_THIS_VALUE_TO_THE_lambdaCid_YOU_GOT_FROM_PREVIOUS_uploadLambda_TASK",
  postSecData:'IMG_20190701_1654519.jpg',
  env:{
    network:'totalIsolated',
    ipAllowed:'none',
    p2pTrafficInAllowed:'owner',
    resultSendBackTo:'owner',
    errorSendBackTo:'owner',
    osRequirement:"none",
    timeOut:'100',
    cleanUpAfter:'totalWipeout'
  },
  executorRequirement:{
    credit:3,
    deposit:10

  },
  multiParties:'none',
  depositAmt:10
});
```
Alice can ask the executor has to have a higher than 3 credit score. The image processing has to be executed while network totally isolated. Alice will pay 10 LEO token for this task. Executor will need to deposit 10 LEO token to work on her task. 

# Layer One put Alice's task into next block
![Layer One accepted Alice's task](./images/layerOneAcceptComputeTask.png)

Alice commit her compute task. Layer one has a new log saying "the compute task pushed into pending tasks".

Now press new block button, we can see new block coming with this task included.

![compute Task posted](./images/computeTaskPosted.png)

In the pendingTasks property, if you open it, you can see the new compute task Cid. that means this task is an on-going active task. In the escrowGasMap property you can see Alice has paid her deposit 10 LEO. You can also see Alice's gas balance is no 490 (it was 500 in last block). The 10 LEO goes to the escrow account. This also cause the Total Gas turns to 18990 (it was 19000).

In our next step, all online nodes will run their VRF to compete Alice's task.
