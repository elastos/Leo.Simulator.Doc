# Alice and Bob verify executor's proof of executor
Alice, as the owner of this computing task, and Bob, as the owner of image processing algorhtm (so called Lambda), are not  members of execution group. However, they are involved in the conesensus we mentioned in the last step. Therefore, hey know who eventually become the executor and who are monitors.

Both Alice and Bob hold their own crypto keys to unlock their private image and lambda code. Without those keys, no one could unlock the code and image. Before Alice and Bob safely send the keys to the executor, they will need to confirm 2 things:
* Only give keys to the executor, no one else
* Need majority of monitors to agree that the executor has the trusted execution environment, and their code and data is running inside the execution environment (This feature to be implemented)

# Executor prepares a docker environment and receive encrypted keys
Based on what Bob described in the image processing service transaction, the execution will be running inside a pre-created docker. Therefore, the executor needs to download the run the docker in executor's memory. 

The docker is an execution environment. The executor still needs code to run and data to load. At this moment, when the execution environment is ready, monitors will make a remote attestation (BTW, this is not a on-time test, the remote attestation is a continue process from the beginning to the end)

Once monitors get the confirmation of executor's environment, they will send the confirmation to Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob will verify those confirmation and the ID of the executor. If they are satisfied, they will give the encrypt key to the executor. All the communications among any nodes are encrypted using RSA.

# Executor runs the code on data
Once the executor receive the encrypt keys from Alice and Bob, he starts to restore the python code and image file to the folder where Bob's docker requried. In our test case, it is the folder of docker, the file names are run.py and test.jpg.

The executor runs the docker. Since the algorthm is pretty simple, it should complete within one second. The result is a file called result.jpg.

The executor encrypts the result.jpg with an random key, then sends the random key to Alice.

# The executor cleans up environment and waits for confimation from monitors

The computation is completed but it doesn't mean the computing task is completed. The executor needs to make sure everything is cleaned up and no trace is left. 

The executor stops docker, remove docker container and image and remove all volumn of tmp files it may use during the execution. The volumn is supposed to be the same as what it was before the execution. 

The technical detail on how the monitors can test the clean-up will be discussed in a separated topic. 

When the monitors see the whole environment is reset without trace left, they will sign a transaction to layer one blockchain as a confirmation.
