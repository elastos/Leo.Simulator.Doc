# Privacy concerns for Alice and Bob
## Bob provide an algorithm based on pay-per-use business model
Bob do not run his code, so he won't get any clients' picture at all. So Bob has nothing to do with any potential privacy leaking from any clients. Yet, he can still make his money as pay-per-use model.

## Alice never got a copy of Bob's code but have her picture processed securely.

Alice did not run Bob's code. And Bob never gave his code to Alice. So Alice has nothing to do with any potential code leakage from Bob.

# Privacy concern in design for Executor
In our demo, executor is the ONLY one who get Bob's code and Alice's picture. So this is the single point of leakage. Let's see how we minimize the risk in our design

## VRF makes no one can predict who will be the executor of a given task.
Executor is selected using VRF. The input of the VRF include
* hash of the next block which contains the compute task
* public and private key of the trial node
* credit value of the trail node
Output of the VRF include
* Random value
* A proof
* A J value (AKA weight)

When Alice post her compute task, she cannot know what the next block hash will be. So she has no way to pre-calculate who will win even she wants to collude with someone she knows well. Everytime she create the transaction need to pay a deposit. Unless Alice has ton of money to waste, she cannot afford trying many times just try to have her buddy win as executor. It is doable, just too expensive to collude. 

Bob has no control on who is going to win VRF either. At least before the executor has been voted from consensus, he doesn't know who the exeuctor is. 

## VRF can be easily verified. Liers will pay huge cost

The VRF output value (random, proof, and J) can be used to verify if someone claimed to win the VRF actually won. 

If any node lies on the VRF, as long as any other monitor verify his VRF failed, the monitor can commit a disbuse to Layer One blockchain. The layer one has the record that the lier node's claim as evidence. Layer one can easily run the VRF to confirm the lier is guilty. If this criminmal is confirmed, the lier will get huge penalty, and the monitor will get huge reward.  Since verifing a VRF is simple and easy, if some hacker want to try, he will lose a lot of money and credit to ground.

## Executors and monitors need to pay deposit and have a credit limit to join the execution group
VRF use candidate's credit as one of the input value. If someone has very low credit score, he has very little chance to win the VRF, not to mention low credit score nodes could be totally barrier out by the preset credit threshold.

For higher credit score nodes, the credit points need days, weeks, months or even years to accumulate. If the node get penalty the cost is huge.
