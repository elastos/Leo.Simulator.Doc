# Layer one blockchain collects all signed confirmation from monitors and task owner

Continue from the last step. Monitors and task owner received remote attestation and task result, they will send confirmation to layer one blockchain. 
For task owner, Alice, she needs to get a key to unlock the file: result.jpg (TODO: Under implmentation). For the monitors, they will need to sign their confirmation to receive the commision (reward).

Once layer one receives majority of the monitor's confirmation (large enough to run a settlement), it will start settlement. 

# Settlement algorithm

There are several steps

## Confirm that there was a consensus from monitors
Layer one smart contract needs to make sure there was a consensus among execution group members. They need to agree on 
* Who is the executor
* If the executor has done the task
* If the executor has done the task under the requirements, especially on security requirement.

The consensus is based on weighted vote of execution group members. The weight is the J value and credit. (TODO: implmeneting weighted vote)

Any monitor can vote Agree or Disagree based on their own remote attestation result. They won't know others' result so there is no way to follow majority. 

Once the weighted vote result is out, all monitors who vote for the same result are winners and the rest are losers.

## Distribute reward Gas

If the result determines the executor has not done a good job, or there is no consensus on who the executor is, then the claim executor and loser monitors will lose their deposit and receive credit penalty. Those monitors who tell the truth will share the claim executor's deposit. Alice will get her deposit back but she did not get her picture processed. She can try again later. No matter what the result is, Bob will get the payment for using his code first. Therefore, Bob will receive $ELA 4 from total escrow remaining.

If the result determines the executor did great job. Layer one block chain will send a key to Alice, so that Alice can use the key to unlock the result.jpg. If there are loser monitors, their deposit will be put into the escrow pool and shared by winners and the executor. For winner monitors and the executor, they will first get back their deposit, then share the remaining of escrow pool for this task. Based on current definition, the executor will win 50% of total reward, other winner monitors share the rest 50%.
## Gas to layer one blockchain
Layer one blockchain won't share the reward with other nodes, but all transaction need a gas, like tax in real world. So whoever receive reward will need to share the gas fee.
## Credit reward
All honest nodes (the executor and monitors) will receive a credit reward as well.
## Credit normalization not inflation
There is no credit inflation in Leo system, however there is a normalization. That means new rewarded credit comes from the shrink of all credit owners. The total credit score won't change for every block, but those who did not get reward credit will have a little shrink (same thing as dilution, just total credit won't change)
## Change state and show in next block
Once layer one blockchain made the settlement, the change on gas will be in the next block.

## See the change in new block
Now, click the next block.
you will see the changes in gas

Also, in the new block, you will see the pending task has been reset. That means this task is completed.

# Mission accomplished

Here we go! We have completed a basic image processing task. Let's review what we learned so far in our last step.
